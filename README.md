## Description

**Parental Control** is a smart contract-based parental permission system designed to control and log all financial transactions initiated by children. This system ensures that payments can only be executed with the explicit permission of the specified owner (the parent or guardian). It provides a comprehensive solution to monitor and manage children's spending while preventing unnecessary or unauthorized payments.

Key features of this project include:

- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Solidity to create smart contracts that enforce parental permission for all financial transactions.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly React.js front-end interface allows parents and guardians to manage permissions, review transaction logs, and gain control over their children's spending.
- **Ethereum Integration**: Integrates with the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent transaction handling.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Implements Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Utilizes the Sepolia testnet for Ethereum contract testing and development.

With Parental Control, you can maintain oversight of your child's financial activities, ensuring responsible spending and enhancing financial management within your family.
