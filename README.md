## Description

**Parental Control** is a smart contract-based parental permission system designed to add an extra layer of security for payments made by minors or dependents. With this system in place, payments can only be executed with the explicit permission of the specified owner (the parent or guardian).

The key features of this project include:
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts written in Solidity are used to manage and enforce parental permission for payments.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly React.js front-end interface allows parents and guardians to manage permissions and view transaction history.
- **Ethereum Integration**: The project utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent transactions.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: The UI is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing design.

Parental Control ensures that financial transactions made by minors are supervised and approved by their designated authorities, helping prevent unauthorized expenditures and ensuring responsible financial behavior.
