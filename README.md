## Description

**Parental Control** is a smart contract-based parental permission system designed to add an extra layer of security for payments made by minors or dependents. With this system in place, payments can only be executed with the explicit permission of the specified owner (the parent or guardian).

The key features of this project include:
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts written in Solidity are used to manage and enforce parental permission for payments.
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly React.js front-end interface allows parents and guardians to manage permissions and view transaction history.
- **Ethereum Integration**: The project utilizes the Ethereum blockchain for secure and transparent transactions.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: The UI is styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing design.

Parental Control ensures that financial transactions made by minors are supervised and approved by their designated authorities, helping prevent unauthorized expenditures and ensuring responsible financial behavior.

   Open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL, which is typically `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Sign In as a Parent or Guardian**:
   - Sign in using your parent or guardian account credentials.
   - If you don't have an account, you may need to register or create one through the application.

3. **Set Up Permissions for Your Child's Account**:
   - After logging in, you should have access to a dashboard or settings page where you can set up permissions for your child's account.
   - Define the rules and conditions under which your child can request payments.

4. **Child Requests Payments**:
   - Your child can use the application to request payments for various purposes.
   - The system will ensure that these payment requests require parental approval before processing.

5. **Parental Approval**:
   - As a parent or guardian, you will receive notifications or alerts when your child requests a payment.
   - Review the payment requests and decide whether to approve or reject them through the application's interface.

6. **Payment Execution**:
   - Once you, as a parent, approve a payment request, the system will execute the payment.
   - The approved amount will be transferred to the child's account, and the transaction will be securely processed on the Ethereum blockchain.

7. **Transaction Record**:
   - All approved payments will be recorded and stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and a secure transaction history.

This process helps parents or guardians oversee and control their child's financial activities, ensuring responsible spending and financial management.
